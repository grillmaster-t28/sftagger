sftagger - simple file tagging tool
===================================
sftagger is a simple file tagging tool written in C

Current Stable Version: 2018/03/31 (3.0 Release)
Development Version: 2018/07/02 (3.1 RC2)

Always use the stable version over the development version as development 
version are prone to breaking your "tags" file.

Installation
------------
Enter the following command to build and install sftagger 
(if necessary as root):

    $ make clean install

Usage
-----
- add category - Make new category/categories and creates a new tags file if it
                 doesn't exists
- add tags - Make new tags append to a category
    - EX: "add tags small big size" - "small big" are the tags, "size" are the 
          category
- add tags-to - Appends tags to the files given
    - EX: "add tags-to *.png"
      - Prompt: "arts plain" - adds the tags "arts" and "plain" to the files 
                               that has ".png" in the suffix
- categories - Lists all categories and tags
- all - Prints out all files available, used like search function but for all
- rename category - Rename the category specified
    - EX: "rename category bar foo" - replaces category "foo" with "bar"
- rename tag - Rename the tag specified
    - EX: "rename tag bar foo" - replaces tag "foo" with "bar"
- remove category - Removes the category specified (only one allowed and a 
                    warning follows after the command entered)
    - EX: "remove category bread_type" - removes category "bread_type"
- remove tags - Removes the tags specified
    - EX: "remove tags white brown" - removes tags "white" and "brown"
- remove from-tags - Removes the tags from the files specified
    - EX: "remove from-tags bread_01.jpg bread_02.jpg"
      - Prompt: "bread" - removes the tag "bread" from the files "bread_01.jpg"
                          and "bread_02.jpg"
- remove files - Removes the files from the list
    - EX: "remove files not_bread_01.jpg not_bread_02.png" - removes the files
                  "not_bread_01.jpg" and "not_bread_02.png" from the list
- read - outputs entire file of tags
- version - outputs the current version
- help - outputs the usage commands

Depreciated commands (by 2.0)
-----------------------------
- create - Creates/overwrites the tags file - REASON: add category does it, and
           tags-to replaces it
- update - Updates the tags file - REASON: No need as tags-to replaces it
- list - Replaced by categories

Using search
------------
Use xargs to make use of the outputs to the program you want to use it with

    $ sftagger search foo | xargs sxiv

Replace "foo" with your searches (can be more than one keyword(s)) and "sxiv"
with your program of choice

Dependencies
------------
- libc (recommend: C99 and POSIX >= 200809)
