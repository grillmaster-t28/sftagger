sftagger - simple file tagging tool
===================================
sftagger is a simple file tagging tool written in C

Current Stable Version: 2017/12/31 (1.0 Release)
Current Development Version: 2018/01/05 (2.0a-05)

Always use the stable version over the development version as development 
version are prone to breaking your "tags" file.

Installation
------------
Enter the following command to build and install sftagger 
(if necessary as root):

    $ make clean install

Usage
-----
- add category - Make new category/categories and creates a new tags file if it
                 doesn't exists
- add tags - Make new tags append to a category
    - EX: "add tags small big size" - "small big" are the tags, "size" are the 
          category
- add tags-to - Appends tags to the files given
    - EX: "add tags-to *.png" - "*.png" are all the files with ".png" extension
- list categories - Lists categories
- list tags-of - Lists tags of the category given
    - EX: "list tags-of size" - "size" are the category
- list all - Lists all categories and tags
- rename category - Rename the category specified
    - EX: "rename category bar foo" - replaces category "foo" with "bar"
- rename tag - Rename the tag specified
    - EX: "rename tag bar foo" - replaces tag "foo" with "bar"
- read - outputs entire file of tags
- version - outputs the current version
- help - outputs the usage commands

Depreciated commands (by 2.0)
-----------------------------
- create - Creates/overwrites the tags file - REASON: add category does it, and
           tags-to replaces it
- update - Updates the tags file - REASON: No need as tags-to replaces it

Using search
------------
Use xargs to make use of the outputs to the program you want to use it with

    $ sftagger search foo | xargs -o sxiv

Replace "foo" with your searches (can be more than one keyword(s)) and "sxiv"
with your program of choice

Dependencies
------------
- libc (recommend: C99 and POSIX >= 200809)

Tested on
---------
- Linux
